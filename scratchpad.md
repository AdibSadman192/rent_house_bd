# Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
